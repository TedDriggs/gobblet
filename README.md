# gobblet

`gobblet` is an implementation of the Gobblet Gobblers board game.
Two players take turns moving their pieces to try and complete a row of three pieces.
Pieces are different sizes: Larger pieces cover smaller ones, preventing those pieces from helping complete rows.

## Usage

After installing the repo, use `cargo run` to start the game.
